# Movie Recommendation System using Alternating Least Squares (ALS)

This repository contains code for building a movie recommendation system using the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm. The system is trained on the MovieLens dataset and provides personalized movie recommendations for users.

## Dataset

The MovieLens dataset is used for training and evaluation. It contains movie ratings provided by users.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Pandas
- Implicit
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the example notebook)

## Example Notebook
The Movie_Recommendation_System.ipynb notebook demonstrates how to:

- Load and preprocess the MovieLens dataset
- Train an ALS recommendation model
- Generate movie recommendations for users
- Evaluate the model's performance
